My task was to create class "Protector", where I have to do the following things:
Create a console program in Python and write a class <Name_from_task> which will contain:

Three additional fields that best describe this class
Designer (with default values)
Destructor
Method that returns a tape representation of a class (__str __ ())
Static field
Static method that returns the value of a static field
In the main () method, identify 3 objects of type from the task (due to the transfer of different number of parameters) and display information about them using the method from step 4 in the console
The developed code should be flooded into the hit repository as a pull request! The repository should have a README and .gitignore file.
